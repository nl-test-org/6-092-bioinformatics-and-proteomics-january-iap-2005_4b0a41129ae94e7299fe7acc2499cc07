Abstract
--------

Interdisciplinary and hands-on approach the topics of bioinformatics and proteomics. Lectures and labs cover sequence analysis, microarray expression analysis, Bayesian methods, control theory, scale-free networks, and biotechnology applications. Designed for those with a computational or engineering background, it will include current real-world examples, actual implementations, and engineering design issues. Where applicable, engineering issues from signal processing, network theory, machine learning, robotics and other domains. New research areas explored using current literature and book chapter materials written by instructors. Guest lecturers from industry and academia. Graduate students particularly encouraged to register. Graduate level problem sets available for those who want them.
